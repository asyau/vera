## 🤖 Intelligent Routing System

### Workflow Trigger Detection

The system automatically analyzes user requests and determines whether to:
1. Use the standard LangChain orchestrator for simple requests
2. Trigger appropriate LangGraph workflows for complex processes

### Trigger Patterns

| Trigger Type | Keywords | Intent Patterns | Confidence Threshold |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Complex Task Request** | multiple, complex, dependencies, project, breakdown | create multiple tasks, complex project, task dependencies | 0.8 |
| **Research Query** | research, analyze, study, investigate, report, findings | research, analyze, investigate, comprehensive study | 0.7 |
| **Planning Request** | plan, strategy, roadmap, team, collaborate, stakeholders | plan, strategy, roadmap, collaborate | 0.75 |
| **Content Creation** | create, write, draft, document, improve, refine, quality | create, write, draft, improve, refine | 0.7 |
| **Automation Request** | automate, process, workflow, steps, sequence, execute | automate, process, workflow, steps | 0.8 |

### Decision Logic

```python
# Complexity analysis
complexity = intent_analysis.get("complexity", "low")
estimated_steps = intent_analysis.get("estimated_steps", 1)

# Trigger conditions
if (complexity in ["high", "medium"] and estimated_steps > 3) or
   (keyword_matches >= threshold and pattern_matches > 0):
    trigger_workflow = True
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Core Intelligent Processing

#### POST `/api/workflows/intelligent`
**Main entry point for intelligent AI processing**

```typescript
interface IntelligentRequest {
  message: string;
  context?: Record<string, any>;
  force_workflow?: string;
  max_iterations?: number;
}

interface IntelligentResponse {
  response_type: "orchestrator" | "workflow_initiated";
  content?: string;
  workflow_info?: WorkflowInfo;
  intent_analysis?: IntentAnalysis;
  message: string;
  next_steps?: string[];
  estimated_completion?: CompletionEstimate;
}
```

**Example Usage**:
```javascript
const response = await api.processIntelligentRequest(
  "Create a comprehensive project plan for launching our new mobile app",
  { project_type: "mobile_app", priority: "high" }
);

if (response.response_type === "workflow_initiated") {
  console.log(`Workflow started: ${response.workflow_info.workflow_id}`);
  console.log(`Next steps: ${response.next_steps.join(', ')}`);
}
```

- **API Cost Optimization**: Intelligent token usage and caching
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

## 🔮 Advanced Features

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop Integration

```python
# Workflow can pause for human input
user_input = interrupt(value="Ready for user input.")
messages = messages + [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
```

### 2. Custom Workflow Creation

```python
# Define custom workflow nodes
def custom_analysis_node(state: WorkflowState) -> WorkflowState:
    # Custom business logic
    return updated_state

# Build custom workflow graph
builder = StateGraph(WorkflowState)
builder.add_node("custom_analysis", custom_analysis_node)
```

### 3. Streaming Updates

```python
# Stream real-time workflow progress
for chunk in workflow.stream(initial_state, config=config):
    yield f"data: {json.dumps(chunk)}\n\n"
```

### 4. Conditional Routing

```python
def route_based_on_complexity(state: WorkflowState) -> str:
    complexity = analyze_complexity(state)
    if complexity > 0.8:
        return "complex_processing"
    else:
        return "simple_processing"
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling and Recovery

### Graceful Degradation

1. **Workflow Failure**: Falls back to standard orchestrator
2. **State Corruption**: Recovers from last valid checkpoint
3. **API Errors**: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Queues workflows for later execution

### Error Types

```python
class WorkflowError(Exception):
    """Base workflow error"""
    pass

class StateCorruptionError(WorkflowError):
    """Workflow state corruption error"""
    pass

class WorkflowTimeoutError(WorkflowError):
    """Workflow execution timeout"""
    pass
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **User Isolation**: Thread-based workflow isolation per user
2. **State Encryption**: Sensitive workflow data encryption
3. **Access Control**: Role-based workflow access permissions
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive workflow execution logging
